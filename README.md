### "The GitHub of Drinking Games"

- A variation of the drinking game, Kings!
- Functions as a playable game as well as a customizable library of games and versions
- Like Kings, players take turns drawing cards, each card rank (2 through King) prompts the player (or the group) to perform a task.
- When a player draws an Ace, he/she then changes one of the rules associated with a chosen card rank, which sticks around permanently. Because of this, the game evolves the more it is played.
- The user can save into a version history when he/she is satisfied with the rules.
- Games can be created from scratch, can be searched for by name, author, and keywords and themes, and all games set to 'public' can be forked, downloaded, and rated.
