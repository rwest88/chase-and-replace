MVC + React architecture (a reminder)

INDEX.js ---> requires react, react-dom, and app.js

>>>

APP.js (client) (page router) ---> requires pages (.js)

>>>

PAGE (client) (require("[utils/API]")  ---> requires Link (react-router-dom) and Components

>>>

UTILS (client) (axios)

>>>

ROUTES (server) (require(express).Router(); const c = require("../../someController");)

>>>

CONTROLLER (server) (const db = require("../models");) --> sends response up to VIEW (changes state)

>>>

MODEL (server) (require("[orm]");

>>>

DB (mongo) (requires Robo3T or Mongo shell to view)
